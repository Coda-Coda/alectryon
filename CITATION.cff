  Proof assistants like Coq, Lean, or HOL4 rely heavily on
  stateful meta-programs called scripts to assemble
  proofs. Unlike pen-and-paper proofs, proof scripts only
  describe the steps to take (induct on x, apply a theorem, …),
  not the states that these steps lead to; as a result, plain
  proof scripts are essentially incomprehensible without the
  assistance of an interactive user interface able to run the
  script and show the corresponding proof states. Until now, the
  standard process to communicate a proof without forcing
  readers to execute its script was to manually copy-paste
  intermediate proof states into the script, as source code
  comments — a tedious and error-prone exercise. Additional
  prose (such as for a book or tutorial) was likewise embedded
  in comments, preserving executability at the cost of a
  mediocre text-editing experience. This paper describes a new
  approach to the development and dissemination of literate
  proof scripts, with a focus on the Coq proof
  assistant. Specifically, we describe two contributions: a
  compiler that interleaves Coq’s output with the original proof
  script to produce interactive webpages that are complete,
  self-contained presentations of Coq proofs; and a new literate
  programming toolkit that allows authors to switch seamlessly
  between prose- and code-oriented views of the same sources, by
  translating back and forth between reStructuredText documents
  and literate Coq source files. In combination, these tools
  offer a new way to write, communicate, and preserve proofs,
  combining the flexibility of procedural proof scripts and the
  intelligibility of declarative proofs.
